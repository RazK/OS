Assignment 1:
#####################
# BRIEF DESCRIPTION #
#####################
Running 'WhatIDo XXX' does the following:
Gets some input string (call it 'XXX') from the user,
Opens a new file at 'Welcome/To/OS2018',
Writes the following len(<username>)+68+len(XXX) characters to that file:
	<username>
	If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
	XXX
Then closes the file,
Deletes it (and by that makes its space available for reuse),
Removes the directories it created along its path,
And finally exists all the threads in the process.
